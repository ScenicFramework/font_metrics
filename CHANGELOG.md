## 0.5.2 - 2024-10-28
Changed default git repo from https://github.com/boydm/font_metrics to https://github.com/ScenicFramework/font_metrics

* Fix compilation warnings (https://github.com/ScenicFramework/font_metrics/pull/3)
* Fix infinite loop in word wrap (https://github.com/ScenicFramework/font_metrics/pull/4)
* Update readme (https://github.com/ScenicFramework/font_metrics/pull/2)

## 0.5.1
* make sha256 the default again as it turns out sha3_256 isn't widely supported enough yet.

## 0.5.0
* Fixed an issue calculating the scale factor used in many of the functions. Now, correctly, uses the units_per_em instead of ascent-descent for the baseline.
* Removed the serialization APIs. Scenic no longer needs them and how you serialize the data in not an opinion the package should have. Use MsgPack. Use :erlang.term_to_binary. Use Jason. This package shouldn't care.
* Standardized the way options are passed in to functions. Some had option lists. Som had a kern parameter that was just a passed in boolean. This is all option lists now.
* Add Specs for types and functions. Confirm Dialyzer passes.
* Add NimbleOptions schemas and validators for all APIs
* The wrap function now wraps at word boundaries. Can also be set to nearest character.


## 0.4.0
* skipped. Going straight to 0.5.0 to have it align to the version of truetype_metrics that will depend on it

## 0.3.1

* Add the wrap function

## 0.3.0

* First public release
